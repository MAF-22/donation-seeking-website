        <h1>Stand with Sylhet</h1>
        <p>The recent heavy rain caused the flood within a very short time. Everyone is trying to survive however they
            can. Some people did manage to go to the refugee camp with their family. Some lost their family on the way
            to the refugee camp. And some people are living on top of their shed hopelessly. Help as much as you can.
            These people needs our help.</p>
